# lightThermo_pcb
PCB carrier board for lightThermo, based on Raspberry PICO.

Schematic, PCB and construction files (gerber) for PBC carrier for lightThermo but can be used to connect generic I2C add-on on Raspberry PICO.

The project contains two folders:
- lightThermo is the schematic and PCB for single device
- lightThermo_panel is the multi-PCB construction file (2 PCB in a single frame)

The project is made with KiCad 9.0.

The resulting PCB is:

The multi-PCB frame is:
![lightThermo_panel](/lightThermo_panel/lightThermo_panel.jpg "multi-PCB of carrier board for lightThermo")

I printed and assembled some samples, here the PCB (without the PICO and the I2C devices):
